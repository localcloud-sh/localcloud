### Quick Install Script

For macOS and Linux, you can also use our install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/localcloud-sh/localcloud/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This script will:
- Detect your OS and architecture
- Use Homebrew if available (macOS)
- Download the appropriate binary
- Install LocalCloud and create the `lc` alias
### Getting Started

```bash
# Initialize a new project
lc init my-assistant
cd my-assistant

# Configure your services (interactive setup)
lc setup
```

You'll see an interactive wizard:
```
? What would you like to build? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ Chat Assistant - Conversational AI with memory
  RAG System - Document Q&A with vector search  
  Speech Processing - Whisper + TTS
  Custom - Select components manually

? Select components you need: (Press <space> to select, <enter> to confirm)
‚ùØ ‚óØ [AI] LLM (Text generation) - Large language models for text generation
  ‚óØ [AI] Embeddings (Semantic search) - Text embeddings for similarity
  ‚óØ [AI] Speech-to-Text (Whisper) - Convert speech to text

  ‚óØ [Infrastructure] Cache (Redis) - In-memory cache for sessions
  ‚óØ [Infrastructure] Queue (Redis) - Job queue for background processing
  ‚óØ [Infrastructure] Object Storage (MinIO) - S3-compatible storage
```

```bash
# Start all selected services
lc start

# Your AI services are now running!
# Check status: lc status
```

> **Note**: `lc` is the short alias for `localcloud` - use whichever you prefer!

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üöÄ One-Command Setup**: Get started in seconds with `lc setup`
- **üí∞ Zero Cloud Costs**: Everything runs locally - no API fees or usage limits
- **üîí Complete Privacy**: Your data never leaves your machine
- **üì¶ Pre-built Templates**: Production-ready backends for common AI use cases
- **üß† Optimized Models**: Carefully selected models that run on 4GB RAM
- **üîß Developer Friendly**: Simple CLI, clear errors, extensible architecture
- **üê≥ Docker-Based**: Consistent environment across all platforms
- **üåê Mobile Ready**: Built-in tunnel support for demos anywhere

## üéØ Vision

**Make AI development as simple as running a local web server.**

LocalCloud eliminates the complexity and cost of AI development by providing a complete, local-first development environment. No cloud bills, no data privacy concerns, no complex configurations - just pure development productivity.

## üí° Perfect For These Scenarios

### üè¢ **Enterprise POCs Without The Red Tape**
Waiting 3 weeks for cloud access approval? Your POC could be done by then. LocalCloud lets you build and demonstrate AI solutions immediately, no IT tickets required.

### üì± **Mobile Demos That Actually Work**
Present from your phone to any client's screen. Built-in tunneling means you can demo your AI app from anywhere - coffee shop WiFi, client office, or conference room.

### üí∏ **The $2,000 Cloud Bill You Forgot About**
We've all been there - spun up a demo, showed the client, forgot to tear it down. With LocalCloud, closing your laptop *is* shutting down the infrastructure.

### üéì **Turn Lecture Recordings into Study Notes**
Got 50 hours of lecture recordings? LocalCloud + Whisper can transcribe them all for free. Add RAG and you've got an AI study buddy that knows your entire course.

### üîê **When "Cloud-First" Meets "Compliance-First"**
Healthcare, finance, government? Some data can't leave the building. LocalCloud keeps everything local while giving you cloud-level capabilities.

### üöÄ **Hackathon Secret Weapon**
No API rate limits. No usage caps. No waiting for credits. Just pure development speed when every minute counts.

### üíº **Build Commercial Products Without Burning Cash**
**Your Own Cursor/Copilot**: Build an AI code editor without $10k/month in API costs during development.  
**AI Mobile Apps**: Develop and test your AI-powered iOS/Android app locally until you're ready to monetize.  
**SaaS MVP**: Validate your AI startup idea without cloud bills - switch to cloud only after getting paying customers.

### üéØ **Technical Interview Assignments That Shine**
**For Employers**: Give candidates a pre-configured LocalCloud environment. No setup headaches, just coding skills evaluation.  
**For Candidates**: Submit a fully-working AI application. While others struggle with API keys, you ship a complete solution.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Internal Tools That Would Never Get Budget**
**AI Customer Support Trainer**: Process your support tickets locally to train a custom assistant.  
**Code Review Bot**: Build a team-specific code reviewer without sending code to external APIs.  
**Meeting Transcription System**: Record, transcribe, and summarize meetings - all on company hardware.
